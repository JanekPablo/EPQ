                        Mind Map: ideas along the lines of passions, Woodwork, Physics, Engineering and Photography. My current Favourite is a Photography Project with working title, Produce and develop a series of film photos. As an artefact EPQ this would allow me to focus on the chemical darkroom process and traditional dodge and burn methods of photography which interests me. The project needs to be discussed with my photography teacher, to determine whether the topic could result in dual accreditation. In the meantime I will do some further research into this idea to decide myself if I think it is feasible and to understand the amount of knowledge required to complete the project. Emailed photography teacher to arrange a meeting.

What Style of film photography do I want to focus on? What Chemicals would I need? What is the best Film to use? How do I develop and edit a picture in the darkroom does the school have the required equipment? etc. From my primary research it seems there is a large source of web based resources on how to develop film but the process isn’t easy and would require a large amount of time to practice and perfect which could be difficult considering the darkroom is on school site and is not always free for student use. The project provides enough content to research and to explore various methods it would also allow for development and testing stages.

                            Discussed the EPQ with Photography teacher Mr Feijoo.

The School also has all the equipment necessary to complete the project on site. He has also offered to help with understanding the process so I could talk to him as part of the research.

<br>The Mind map I produced on the 10/10/17 had a variety of ideas however didn’t include one I felt very passionately about. Having discussed the EPQ project with a couple of physics teachers to get an idea of what I could do, one of my teachers suggested I focused a project on learning a coding language. So with this in mind I decided I would start my project on the idea of developing a light meter, which takes lux value and converts it to shutter and aperture. This would combine a lot of my interests. The problem solving aspect of writing code appealed to me and learning this new skill could be very useful, when going to Uni. As within lots of STEM subject at university they start teaching some basic coding languages, so a prior knowledge could come in handy. Furthermore this would combine knowledge of the workings of a camera, however more in depth than is covered in our photography lessons. </p>

                            Before meeting with Mr Grey the head of computer science I felt I needed to have a basic understanding of the maths involved in changing the lux light value to the shutter and aperture speeds. This involved research on reciprocity failure and Exposure values. This was initially done on Wikipedia however using their referencing realised most of the mathematics was sourced from a book called the Manual of Photography. I couldn’t find this on amazon there was however another version being sold for £50 so I decided to look in the Cambridge libraries.

<br><em>Mr Grey,
<br>I'm in year 13 and just started an EPQ in which I plan to learn the basics of coding through making a light meter which transfers its digital signal generated into information for a photographer, shutter speed and aperture. It’s been suggested that I have a chat with someone who can advise me on what language I should use and resources I can use to go about the process of learning the coding involved. Would you be free at any point during the week to meet with me?

                            We discussed different possibilities, Me Grey found the project would be feasible, but had some queries about the use of the raspberry pi. He thought it could equally be done using the phones camera. However, I noted that part of my plan was to use an accurate light sensor, so this wouldn’t work. With this in mind he noted he wasn’t sure I could run C# on the raspberry pi. However, again this shouldn’t be a problem as although on option of development is making the whole process a hand-held device, therefore running everything of the raspberry pi, this isn’t what I had in mind. Overall in terms of learning the coding language he suggested I start with trying to convert my mathematical understanding from my research into some simple C# console code.

This involved learning a variety of different feature of the C# language. I essentially read the first chapter of the book C# in a nutshell written by Peter Drayton, Ben Albahari and Ted Neward. This taught me the type basics and value types. In general id didn’t take too long to gain understanding of how things were setup. However, it took a few iterations of the code to make sure it worked as I had to use bout integers and doubles and often errors would occur when I was converting between these. Getting user input converted into an integer or double was something I sourced from stack overflow trying to find conversation threads on this topic.  The console code: <a href="https://repl.it/@JanekPablo/EPQ ">https://repl.it/@JanekPablo/EPQ &nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br></p>

                            Outcome of Code Test</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Part of the process was to analysing this code and understanding what I had to do to improve it and what I needed to research further.  
<br>This console code runs in such a way that the user inputs the lux value, the aperture and the films reciprocity factor and outputs a shutter speed. The most complex part of this code is the if statement which ensures the code only takes the reciprocity factor into account if the shutter speed is longer than 1 sec. The code could be easily changed to allow for an output of Aperture with the input of Shutter Speed. However, there are a couple of problems with the code, firstly it is set for an ISO of 100, which should really be a variable dependent on the film so shouldn’t be a fixed value. Another problem is that the output shutter value is a decimal which, is ok if the value is above 1 sec as the value can be rounded and result in an understandable setting for the photographer, however ideally when below 1 sec the aim is that the value defaults to the cameras set shutter intervals which should be given in fractions as it is given on the camera. These two points I will work on and further research is needed in terms of how this can be achieved. &nbsp;<br></p>

                            Further Coding Hardware Plan</h4>
                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">To develop the project, I decided to start work on the hardware required to generate lux values automatically. As one of the main aims of the project is to have an automatic process from light value to output information.  To achieve this part of my initial plan was to use a raspberry pi connected to a light sensor to collect lux information and relay it to the software application. The more complex part was planning how my software application would receive this information automatically. Which is what I need to do further research on as I haven’t yet decided how this would work. However, to start I ordered a raspberry pi zero w and a light sensor which I could then work on setting up. Whilst the raspberry pi was in the post I decided to continue the development of my code. I stared by coding a form application with Visual Studio again this was also C# however it involved learning how to set up classes and assign data to these classes. This would allow me to make dropdown selection boxes with assigned data. However, before going too far, I realised I should make a proper plan in terms of how it would be converted to an app as this was essentially the best outcome. Also, I thought the best outcome would be an automatic connection with the raspberry pi, so I wanted to think about this before I started coding a form, which may not be the best solution.  Equally I decided it would be a good ide to develop a design in terms of what the application should look like and what features are present.
<br>I discussed a while ago that I was trying to source a book called the manual of photography I have already tried taking a letter from school requesting my access to Anglia Ruskin library which I was informed normally allows access when trying to research for and EPQ however I wasn’t allowed in. So instead I tried sourcing a second-hand version and found the exact same copy being referenced ion Wikipedia for around £5.00 on eBay so ordered this. &nbsp;<br></p>

                            Raspberry Pi Seup</h4>      
                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Having received the Raspberry Pi, I started to set this up. This firstly involved formatting a SD card and downloading the Raspian operating system and transfer the system onto the SD Card. Given that the Raspberry Pi Zero was WIFI enabled I could potential wok on it using an SSH connection meaning I wouldn’t have to plug it into my monitor or attach a keyboard. To set this up before it is booted up it needs to automatically connect with our WIFI to allow for this I followed this tutorial, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlCr09B2HZI ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlCr09B2HZI </a>which shows which files need to be altered or added to allow for this quick wireless setup. However, I found it didn’t work so I tried again by wiping the SD card and re installing the raspian image.  But it didn’t work so I resorted to plugging the raspberry pi into my monitor and using a wired keyboard to interact with it. This clearly worked, and I was able to connect it to our WIFI and change the hostname, meaning when I powered it on next time I could SSH into it. Having setup, the Pi the next step was soldering on the pin board to the GPIO (General Pin Input Output) connectors. 
<br>Having considered my options when it comes to trying to wirelessly connect the raspberry pi with a light meter application, I thought that a good solution could be to start the process with the Lux Value being displayed on the Pi via  screen so the user could manually input the Lux value then later on in the [project I could explore various solutions to the automatic connection between raspberry pi and app. To allow for this I ordered an Adafruit PiOLED - 128x32 Monochrome OLED screen this could directly plugin to these pin connectors soldered onto the pi, and display information. I installed a test repository from Adafruit to test this and all worked well.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The next step was connecting the lux sensor at this point the sensor required the same i2c connection pins that the screen was using so to setup the sensor I took the screen off whilst I ordered more connection pins that could be soldered to the screen to extend the i2c connection. 
<br>The Sensor again was wired simply using an Adafruit based tutorial which also runs through the process of installing the required repositories to the pi. 
<br>This also managed to work picking up a light value straight away. &nbsp;<br></p>

                            At this point I decided to start recording my process fortnightly as I needed to do a lot more research on the coding front and decided a solution in terms of connecting the raspberry pi to the application. My plan of using a screen at the same time as the sensor and allowing for the user to transfer the data manually defeats the idea of a light sensor application as it supposed to be quick and easy. So, I did some further research on how this could be achieved.   The research process took a lot of time and It didn’t make sense recording everything I looked at in my diary.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">There were a couple of platforms I found that supported the use of connecting the raspberry pi to an application.  They are referred to as an IOT (Internet of Things) platform. This is a way of connecting sensors and “things” to the internet. There are several different companies focusing on hardware, device management and connectivity. One of these which was of interest was a piece of software called Cayenne My Devices. Which when downloaded onto the raspberry pi would connect to an online dashboard where you could drag and drop various switches or graphs to control or share data from the pi. Once this works there is opportunity to customize your own code or develop you own tiles. However, once I had managed to setup a connection it didn’t seem to be very quick or responsive. So, this wasn’t a feasible solution.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Seeing as these platforms weren’t working with the pi, it was suggested to me to carry on developing the project as a web-based solution this allowed me to use something called a WebSocket, where the pi could communicate with the web page. This is essentially how these platforms work, but it wouldn’t be too difficult to code my own connection. Also, if I went down this route of generating a web page there were other platforms that would allow for me to easily convert this web page into an android or iOS app, for example a platform called Go Native.
<br>So, having decided this would be a good way forward I needed to start learning the basics of web development HTML JavaScript and CSS. To start this process, I decided to change my console code maths function from C# to JavaScript this didn’t take too long as the general setup of the maths function was kept the same. 
<br>Know that I knew I could eventually convert the webpage into an app. I planned the design with the final app look in mind this plan can be found on the home page of my website. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                            This week was half term, so I spent a lot of time writing the code starting the basic index.html code and the server-side code which did both open a WebSocket, and act as a server. This meant that when the webpage was searched for the raspberry pi would provide the site and then connect with it via a WebSocket relaying the lux values at a set time interval. Once I had managed to create this connection and the raspberry pi was required with the light sensor, it was simple to start sending lux values across. This now working allowed me to focus on the development of my app, and I could follow the design I had completed the previous week. The general function of the application was working, however the connection across the internet and the fact that the raspberry pi was acting as the server meant the connection relied on the pi being connected to the WIFI. So, at this point the device wouldn’t work outside the house as it was setup for my home WIFI.

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">This week a carried on finalising the code and found a potential solution for the WIFI problem. To get teachers and peers to review the product at school I thought I could take the raspberry pi to school and alter it to connect to the school WIFI. This however didn’t work, as the school WIFI required my specific login details this wasn’t possible to input into the pi. 
<br>This problem could be solved another way, in that the pi can be programmed to act as an access point in a standalone network, this could potentially allow me to setup a network that the pi runs on and the device the app is working would only need to connect to this network then communication between the device would work. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">I tried implementing NAT (standalone network) using https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/access-point.md the tutorial hosted on the raspberry pi network, however this didn’t work. So, I tried wiping the SD card to get rid of all the changes I had made to the pi throughout the project to try again. This still didn’t work. To make sure I had evidence of a working device I decided to leave this and just focus on finishing it to work at home, so I reinstalled all the features I had just wiped of the SD card and set up the p so the app.js file seen in my outcome page would run from boot. 
<br>This whole process took quite a while as I tried various tutorials on setting up a wireless access-point. None of which worked. 
<br>During this fortnight I wrote my mid-way project review which explained the reasons for the change from C# to web-based code, HTML JavaScript and CSS. &nbsp;<br></p>

                            To get any sort of feedback I decided to video the device working, this would allow me to show the device to people at school. In the meantime, I needed to start writing my report.  So, I focused on this.

<br>As well as trying to get some more peer reviews, to get people to view the project in my house where it was working. Also, as part of my title I was planning to test how it worked in terms of taking photos. So, I set up a test shoot where I used the light meter to determine the exposure time, and then got these images developed in town. &nbsp;<br></p>

                    <p class="mbr-timeline-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Once getting advice from my supervisor on the report so far, I made some changes and added a variety of features such as inputting appendices with the code developed through the project, as well as the test console code. 
<br>Once I had finished the report I then started planning and finalising my PowerPoint as my presentation was scheduled for the 24th. I arranged for my Photography teacher Mr Dean and my Physics teacher Mr Rocks to come along for the 10-minute presentation, so they could ask m e questions about the project. AS I knew it would be difficult to explain the concept to people who don’t understand the maths or the photographic concepts of Aperture Shutter Speed and ISO. &nbsp;<br></p>
